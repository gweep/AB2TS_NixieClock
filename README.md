NOTE: I do not have access to all operating systems and machine types.  Given the complexities of writing a single app for multiple operating systems, I cannot guarantee that every item of text or button in the app is displayed optimally.  This application has been tested on the following computers.

Recent Apple Intel and Apple Silicon (ARM) computers.

Virtual Windows 10 & 11.

Virtual Linux.


Note: The NixieClock window always floats on top of all other application windows.  NixieClock has a convenient Tool Bar with helpful icons that are used to set preferences.  If you elect to hide the Tool Bar, you will need to access the preference settings via the NixieClock menu bar.  Depending upon your machine and operating system, the menu bar may not be immediatly visible.  This is because even though the NixieClock window is always on top; the NixieClock app may not be the top most open application.  You may need to cycle through your open applications to find the NixieClock menu bar.
