NOTE: I do not have access to all operating systems and machine types.  Given the complexities of writing a single app for multiple operating systems, I cannot guarantee that every piece of text or button in the app is displayed optimally.  This application has been tested on the following computers.

Recent Intel and Apple Silicon (ARM) computers.
Virtual Windows 10 & 11.
Virtual Linux.
